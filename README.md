## Licensing
Source code is licensed under the EUPL version 1.2

### Assets are not yet freely available
Some of them were purchased, others were obtained for free but are not owned 
by me. I'm still investigating how I want to handle licensing assets. I 
would like to eventually like to license all assets as Creative Commons if 
possible, but I'm not sure I will have the resources to do so or be able to 
find assets that are already so licensed.
